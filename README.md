## Development

This project is powered by `bun`. To get the API up and running, simply execute `bun install` followed by `bun run dev`.

Workspace management is handled by the [`Turbo`](https://turbo.build/repo) repo, ensuring a smooth development experience.

The heart of the project, `apps/api`, hosts the API. It leverages the `vts-core` package as an internal dependency. We might export this dependency in the future!
